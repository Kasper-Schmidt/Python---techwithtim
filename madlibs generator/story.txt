Today I woke up feeling extremely <adjective1>. I jumped out of bed, put on my favorite <adjective2> <clothing_item>, and ran outside to chase a <animal>.

Suddenly, <celebrity> appeared out of nowhere and shouted, “You forgot your <random_object>!” I was so <emotion> that I accidentally dropped my <food> into a puddle of <liquid>.

To fix everything, I had to <verb> all the way to <place>, where a wise old <profession> told me, “Never trust a <adjective3> <animal> holding a <object1>.”

And that’s why I now carry a <adjective4> <object2> with me everywhere I go.
